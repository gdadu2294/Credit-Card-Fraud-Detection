# Credit Card Fraud Detection Research Project

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code, resources, and findings for the research on Credit Card Fraud Detection. The primary goal of this research is to compare and evaluate three distinct machine learning models—Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression—for the purpose of accurate credit card fraud detection. The repository aims to delve into feature importance, feature engineering, and the relationship between different transaction types and their correlation with fraudulent activities.

## Repository Contents
- `Literature_Review.pdf`: The comprehensive review of previous studies and methodologies in credit card fraud detection.
- `Initial_Results_and_Code.ipynb`: Initial results and code detailing the models' development and performance evaluation.
- `Initial_Results_and_Code.pdf`: Supplementary document accompanying the initial results and code for reference.
- `Initial_Dataset_Visualization.ipynb`: Initial visualizations providing insights into the dataset's structure.
