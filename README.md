## About

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for my research on Credit Card Fraud Detection. The primary goal of this research is to compare and evaluate three distinct machine learning models - Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression - for the purpose of accurate credit card fraud detection. It also explores feature importance, feature engineering, and the relationship between different transaction types and their correlation with fraudulent activities.

## Abstract

Credit Card Fraud Detection is a critical concern within the financial sector, demanding advanced techniques for precise identification and prevention. This research paper delves into the realm of Big Data and Predictive Analysis, aiming to develop and compare three distinct machine learning models for the purpose of accurate credit card fraud detection. The paper systematically evaluates the three models to determine their respective performance levels in credit card fraud detection.
